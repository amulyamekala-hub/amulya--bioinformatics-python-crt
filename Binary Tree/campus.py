'''Scenario 1:Vignan Campus Map
context: Each bullding in a college campus is a node, and walkable paths are edges,.
Represent the campus map using an adjacency list, 
Check If there's a path from the library to the Auditorium using BFS.List all buildings that are directly connected to the Admin Block.
Use DFS to visit all reachable buildings from the Main Gate. 
Find if there are any disconnected buildings (buildings not connected to campus).'''
